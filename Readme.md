Belley Rani Bala - selenium + JUnit 5 testing of hudl.com
This project can be also found here: https://github.com/BelleyRaniBala/HudlTest.git

This is a maven project. You need JDK8 to run it.

When you have your maven ready run:
mvn clean package

if you don't have maven ready, you can try the included maven using:
mvn clean package

That will execute all Login tests inside of the framework.
I run my test from IntelliJ comunity edition on Windows.

In case you would like to use firefox driver, please change the details in the com.hudl.Launcher class.
